<h2 style=padding:10px>(f) Find the z-score for the 24th percentile</h2>

<div style="background-color: #BCDBF5 ; padding: 10px;">

<p>Consider the following classic physics problem: A block of mass m1 is released from rest from the top of a frictionless ramp of height h, then collides inelastically with a block of mass m2 (so they stick together). Find the final speed of the blocks. 
Write a function that takes inputs h, m1, and m2, and calculates the final speed of the blocks. Then use pyplot to investigate how varying the values for h, m1, and m2, affects the final speed of the blocks after the collision.</p>
