Progress report: =========
-prototype coded about half the worksheet 
-first 3 questions for student version prototype
	~started to think about problems with format, and instructions to include 


Questions for Yolanda: =======

What do you think about the student version prototype? 
Should I continue to put time into considering Jupyter notebooks as development environment? 


Questions for Teacher: ======
It would be helpful to have any extra context for the lesson, or what the learning outcomes/ goals are for the stats worksheet 
~even the chapter of the textbook that corresponds to the material 







STATS DEFIINTIONS : =======


Normalcdf() is the normal (Gaussian) cumulative distribution function on the TI 83/TI 84 calculator. If a random variable is normally distributed, you can use the normalcdf command to find the probability that the variable will fall into a certain interval that you supply.
~calculates the probability that the variable will fall into the interval you supply as a parameter (in our case z)

Normalpdf() is the probability density function 
~

PYTHON NOTES: =======

Plotting the normal dist. curve 
	#x = np.linspace(start of interval = -5, end of interval = 5, num of items to generate within the range = 200)
	 ~using 200 because the fill function is more precise if there are more numbers generated per interval

	#y = norm.pdf(x, mean, std_dev) 
	`~pdf(x, loc=0, scale=1)

	Shading inside the curve 
Distributions

norm.ppf calculate the z score with Percent Point Function which is the inverse of normalCDF function




Concerns about Jupyter notebook: ================
1.The students will need to be able to revert cells back to original state if they mess them up somehow (such as delete part of the code on accident) 
2. We will need to teach them how to use the environment before they can do the worksheet 
3.
